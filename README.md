# WebScrapingProject
This folder contains multiple different web scraping programs used for different purposes.

The first set of programs (mal_scrape_proto.py) is a personal project where I wanted to calculate how long it would take to watch every anime (I'm a huge nerd). So I scraped the data from the biggest anime database and wrote it to one large CSV file. There I converted it to a Excel file to actually do the calculations to see how long it would take to watch every anime, how long it would take to watch some specific genres, and also if it was even posible for a normal human to do this.

The second program (description_scraping.py) is pretty much the exact same as the first, except I compiled all the descriptions of these shows. I did it (again for fun) to try to retrain the text generating AI GPT-2 to make fake anime descriptions that would fool a human. I didn't get amazing results because of how I indexed the data while retraining GPT-2, but I still got some fun descriptions that fooled my friends.

This project was entirely for fun and to help myself learn python in a way that was engaging.
